WPS-CandyFolder
===============

WPS. CandyBarz provides transparent folders to WPS.

CandyFolder is an add on for CandyBarZ which brings you (pseudo)transparency for WPS-folders. It also works stand alone so you may use it with your prefered WPS-beautifier. 

CandyFolder is a replacement folder class for seemless integration into the system. It's reported to work with other WPS enhancers like XFolder, XWorplace, WPS-Wizard. There's no reason it shouldn't work with any other enhancer, too.
